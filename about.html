<p>Growing up, my mother would always make me drink multiple scrotching cups of tea telling me I would get better. And everytime, without fail, I was all better the next day.</p>

<p>It is well known that tea has healing properties, and as a nurse, my mom knew all that heat would whip me back into shape. That is where my love for tea came from. It came from knowing I will always be alright as long as I have a cup.</p>

<p>Kozie Korner is a family business that I created for the purpose of spreading this wonderful beverage all over the country. We distribute all your favorite teas from all over the world and bring them to you.</p>
